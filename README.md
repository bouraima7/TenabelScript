Excel Export Script

This Python script is designed to read data from a CSV file, display specific columns, and export the data to an Excel file. The script uses the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `openpyxl` for Excel file operations.
 
 Installation
 
Before running the script, ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:
pip install pandas openpyxl
 
 Script Behavior
 
The script performs the following actions:
1. Read CSV File:
   - Uses the `read_csv_file` function to read a CSV file into a panda DataFrame.
   - Provides error handling for common file reading issues, such as file not found or an empty file.

2. Display Columns:
   - Checks if the data is available.
   - If data is available, it prints the entire contents of specific columns from the DataFrame.

3. Export to Excel:
   - Generates an Excel file path with a timestamp to avoid overwriting existing files.
   - Exports the DataFrame to an Excel file using the `to_excel` method.
   - Provides error handling for potential issues during the export process.

  Output
  
If the script runs successfully, it will display the contents of selected columns and notify you of the successful export to an Excel file. If there are issues, error messages will be printed to the console.

Configuration

1. CSV File Path:
  - Modify the `file_path` variable to specify the path to your CSV file.
2. Excel File Path:
  - The script generates an Excel file with a timestamp to avoid overwriting existing files. You can modify the `excel_file_path` variable if you want to specify a different path.

Dependencies
- pandas
- openpyxl
Ensure that you have these dependencies installed before running the script.
